In this directory, we make some improvements for the etbr codes.

10/4/2011. We create a new etbr_cmd interface to suit the TAU P/G contest hosted by IBM. Duo Li made the changes with the help of Zao Liu.

Following is the list of changes made by Duo

1. Added a new option "-ec". With this option, etbr_cmd will do error control. By default, no error control.

2.Added a new option "-fast". With this option, etbr_cmd will do etbr with default order 20. By default, mna is used.

3.Revised parser code, so it can handle pulse command now.
I didn't use your code as I already did the code change before I saw your email.

4.Multi-threading etbr is controlled by "-mt" option. It can return the same result as etbr now.

5.Made the output more neat. For the contest build, please use the last DEBUGFLAGS in the Makefile and do “make”.

6. Also the new codes can read the PULSE commands from the IBM benchmarks.

For this test case, etbr_cmd default completes in 13s; 
etbr_cmd -fast (default order 20) completes in 11s; 
etbr_cmd -fast -mt completes in 9s. 
etbr_cmd -fast can return the comparable results to etbr_cmd. 
etbr_cmd -fast -nq 30 can get better results but more runtime.
